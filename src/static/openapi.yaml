    # Introduction
    ---
    RESTful APIs that allow an OP to share the edge cloud resources and capabilities securely to other partner OPs over E/WBI.

    ---
    # API Scope

    ---
    APIs defined in this version of the implementation can be categorized into the following areas:
    * __FederationManagement__ - Create and manage directed federation relationship with a partner OP
    * __AvailabilityZoneInfoSynchronization__ - Management of resources of partner OP zones and status updates
    * __ArtefactManagement__ - Upload, remove, retrieve and update application descriptors, charts and packages over E/WBI towards a partner OP
    * __ApplicationOnboardingManagement__ - Register, retrieve, update and remove applications over E/WBI towards a partner OP
    * __ApplicationDeploymentManagement__ - Create, update, retrieve and terminate application instances over E/WBI towards a partner OP

    ---
    # Definitions
    ---
    This section provides definitions of terminologies commonly referred to throughout the API descriptions.

    * __Accepted Zones__ - List of partner OP zones, which the originating OP has confirmed to use for its edge applications.
    * __Application Provider__ - An application developer, onboarding his/her edge application on a partner operator platform (MEC).
    * __Artefact__ - Descriptor, charts or any other package associated with the application.
    * __Availability Zone__ - Zones that partner OP can offer to share with originating OP.
    * __Device__ - Refers to user equipment like mobile phone, tablet, IOT kit, AR/VR device etc. In context of MEC users use these devices to access edge applications.
    * __Directed Federation__ - A Federation between two OP instances A and B, in which edge compute resources are shared by B to A, but not from A to B.
    * __Edge Application__ - Application designed to run on MEC edge cloud.
    * __E/WBI__ - East west bound interface.
    * __Federation__ - Relationship among member OPs who agrees to offer services and capabilities to the application providers and end users of member OPs.
    * __FederationContextId__ - Partner OP defined string identifier representing a certain federation relationship.
    * __Federation Identifier__ - Identify an operator platform in federation context.
    * __Flavour__ - A group of compute, network and storage resources that can be requested or granted as a single unit.
    * __FlavourIdentifier__ - An OP defined string identifier representing a set of compute, storage and networking resources.
    * __Home OP__ - Used in federation context to identify the OP with which the application developers or user clients are registered.
    * __Instance__ - Application process running on an edge.
    * __LCM Service__ - Partner OP service responsible for life cycle management of edge applications. LCM service is defined as HTTP based API endpoint identified by a well-defined FQDN or IP.
    * __Offered Zones__ - Zones that partner OP offer to share to the Originating OP based on the prior agreement and local configuration.
    * __Onboarding__ - Submitting an application to MEC platform.
    * __OP__ - Operator platform.
    * __OperatorIdentifier__ - String identifier representing the owner of MEC platform. Owner could be an enterprise, a TSP or some other organization.
    * __Originating OP__ - The OP when initiating the federation creation request towards the partner OP is defined as the Originating OP.
    * __Partner OP__ - Operator Platform which offers its Edge Cloud capabilities to the other Operator Platforms via E/WBI.
    * __Resource__ - Compute, networking and storage resources.
    * __ZoneIdentifier__ - An OP defined string identifier representing a certain geographical or logical area where edge resources and services are provided.
    * __Zone Confirmation__ - Procedure via which originating OP acknowledges partner OP about the partner zones it wishes to use.
    * __User Clients__ - Lightweight client applications used to access edge applications. Application users run  these clients on their devices (UE, IOT device, AR/VR device etc).

    # API Operations
    ---

    __FederationManagement__
    * __CreateFederation__ - Creates a directed federation relationship with a partner OP.

    __AvailabilityZoneInfoSynchronization__
    * __ZoneSubscribe__ - Informs partner OP that originating OP is willing to access the specified zones and partner OP shall reserve compute and network resources for these zones.
    * __ZoneUnsubscribe__ - Informs partner OP that originating OP will no longer access the specified partner OP zone.
    * __GetZoneData__ - Retrieves details about the computation and network resources that partner OP has reserved for an partner OP zone.
    * __Notify Zone Information__ - Call back notification used by partner OP to update originating OP about changes in the resources reserved on a partner zone.

    __ArtefactManagement__
    * __UploadArtefact__ - Uploads application artefact on partner operator platform.
    * __RemoveArtefact__ - Removes an artefact from partner operator platform.
    * __GetArtefact__ - Retrieves details about an artefact from partner operator platform.

    __ApplicationOnboardingManagement__
    * __OnboardApplication__ - Submits an application details to a partner OP. Based on the details provided,  partner OP shall do bookkeeping, resource validation and other pre-deployment operations.
    * __UpdateApplication__ - Updates partner OP about changes in application compute resource requirements, QOS Profile, associated descriptor or change in associated components.
    * __DeboardApplication__ - Removes an application from partner OP.
    * __ViewApplication__ - Retrieves application details from partner OP.
    * __OnboardExistingAppNewZones__ - Make an application available on new additional zones.
    * __LockUnlockApplicationZone__ - Forbid or permit instantiation of application on a zone.

    __Application Instance Lifecycle Management__
    * __InstallApp__ - Instantiates an application on a partner OP zone.
    * __GetAppInstanceDetails__ - Retrieves an application instance details from partner OP.
    * __RemoveApp__ - Terminate an application instance on a partner OP zone.
    * __GetAllAppInstances__ - Retrieves details about all instances of the application running on partner OP zones.
